  <h2 class="faq__question">What is {{config.title}}?</h2>
  <div class="faq__answer flow-space-300">
    <p>{{config.title}} will get you orignal URL from shortened or tracking URLs. It comes handy when the tracking URL is blocked in your local network because of Ad blockers like <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a> or <a href="https://nextdns.io/">NextDNS</a>. Remember those unsubscribe links that your Ad blocker blocks? I made this for them.</p>

  <h2 class="faq__question">How does it work?</h2>
  <div class="faq__answer flow-space-300">
    <p>UP tries to read the encoded URL in the URLs. If it couldn&#8217;t find a target URL, it would use <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch"><code>fetch()</code></a> to get one. All of these are done using Netlify Functions.</p>
